In June, at WWDC 2017, Apple introduced an updated 12.9” iPad Pro along with a new 10.5” size.  I’ve owned the 10.5 Pro for several months now, replacing my old iPad Mini 4.
Jumping from an iPad Mini to a Pro was a big jump in size.  I liked the portability of the Mini but since switching to an iPhone 7 Plus, I found that I really wanted in my iPad was more capability.  My iPhone can handle being the device that is always with me; I’m looking for my iPad to take over some of the jobs that require my Mac.

The best way to think of the Pro is that it’s a regular iPad, but better in every way:
- The screen size of the 10.5 is just a bit bigger than the 9.7” of mainstream iPads, but thanks to smaller bezels, the body itself is just about the same size.  The extra size isn’t a game changer but it is helpful, particularly when typing on screen. It’s just enough extra space to make a difference.
- The screen is also brighter (I had no trouble using it in daytime), has automatic colour balancing against ambient lighting (so it looks “right” more of the time), and has beautiful wide-colour support.
- The speakers are loud enough for every day use, while other iPads have also sounded on the quiet side to me.  I took it with my on vacation and watched several movies on it with the volume cranked up, and it was a good experience.  The overall sound quality is still a *bit* tinny but otherwise it was much better than any other iPad can manage.
- It’s blazing fast.  Others can give you the benchmarks but for every day use this iPad is as fast or faster than many laptops, and I never once felt like I wished it was faster.  It just keeps up with you.
- It’s available with 64, 256,  or 512 GB of storage.  The latter two sizes put it right up into laptop territory, and it’s enough that I never felt like I had to spend a lot of time managing my storage usage, even when loading it up with movies and other entertainment for vacations.
- It has exactly the same cameras as the iPhone 7.  While I’ve never been one to choose an iPad as a camera, sometimes it’s the device closest to hand.  With the Pro, I don’t have to worry that I’m not getting excellent photo quality when that happens.
- It support the Apple Smart Keyboard and the Apple Pencil, but I haven’t yet bought either one of those.  I did buy a third party [Bluetooth Keyboard](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01LC1H92C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), but I haven’t really successfully gotten used to it and I still have a lot of missed characters when type with it.  I suspect a Smart Keyboard is in my future and I’ll write about that here as well.

Overall, I’m very happy with with the 10.5” iPad Pro.  It does whatever I need and it has a lot of room to handle more in the future.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for more out of their iPad.
